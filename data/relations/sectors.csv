TC,All,Aggregate of energy consumption for given source regardless of sector
IC,Industrial ,"An energy-consuming sector that consists of all facilities and equipment used for producing, processing, or assembling goods. The industrial sector encompasses the following types of activity: manufacturing (NAICS codes 31-33); agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting (NAICS code 11); mining, including oil and gas extraction (NAICS code 21); and construction (NAICS code 23). Overall energy use in this sector is largely for process heat and cooling and powering machinery, with lesser amounts used for facility heating, air conditioning, and lighting. Fossil fuels are also used as raw material inputs to manufactured products. Note: This sector includes generators that produce electricity and/or useful thermal output primarily to support the above-mentioned industrial activities."
AC,Transportation ,"An energy-consuming sector that consists of all vehicles whose primary purpose is transporting people and/or goods from one physical location to another. Included are automobiles; trucks; buses; motorcycles; trains, subways, and other rail vehicles; aircraft; and ships, barges, and other waterborne vehicles. Vehicles whose primary purpose is not transportation (e.g., construction cranes and bulldozers, farming vehicles, and warehouse tractors and forklifts) are classified in the sector of their primary use. In this report, natural gas used in the operation of natural gas pipelines is included in the transportation sector."
EI,Electric power ,"An energy-consuming sector that consists of electricity-only and combined-heat-and-power plants within the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) 22 category whose primary business is to sell electricity, or electricity and heat, to the public. Note: This sector includes electric utilities and independent power producers."
RC,Residential ,"An energy-consuming sector that consists of living quarters for private households. Common uses of energy associated with this sector include space heating, water heating, air conditioning, lighting, refrigeration, cooking, and running a variety of other appliances. The residential sector excludes institutional living quarters"
CC,Commercial ,"An energy-consuming sector that consists of service-providing facilities and equipment of: businesses; federal, state, and local governments; and other private and public organizations, such as religious, social, or fraternal groups. The commercial sector includes institutional living quarters. It also includes sewage treatment facilities. Common uses of energy associated with this sector include space heating, water heating, air conditioning, lighting, refrigeration, cooking, and running a wide variety of other by the quantity of electricity purchased rather than by the business activity of the purchaser. Natural gas used in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries was collected and reported in the commercial sector through 1995. Beginning with 1996 data, deliveries of natural gas for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries are reported in the industrial sector instead. Another example is master-metered condominiums and apartments and buildings with a combination of residential and commercial units. In many cases, the metering and billing practices cause residential energy usage of electricity, natural gas, or fuel oil to be included in the commercial sector. No adjustments for these discrepancies were made. SEDS does not provide further disaggregated end-use consumption estimates. For example, the industrial sector cannot be broken down into the chemical or rubber industries, all manufacturing, or agriculture. The input series for the T system are provided in broad end-use categories from the data collection I forms and are not available by the individual components. Additional disaggregated regional information, such as counties or cities, are also not O available in SEDS."
